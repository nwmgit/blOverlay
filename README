/**
 * blOverlay
 * 4 optional parameters
 * @param {Object} align
 * @param {Object} rgb
 * @param {Object} alpha
 * @param {Object} speed
 * usage example: 
 * $("#primaryfeaturecontent h1").blOverlay('right','0,5,10',0.5,1000); // a right-aligned, dark, 50% opaque background block that moves into view in a 1 second duration animation
 * IE8 and Opera 9 do not yet have support for the rgba (rgb alpha) CSS3 property - so defaults to 100% opacity
